Less than 15 minutes from downtown. 7 Bedrooms, 3 full bathrooms and 3 kitchens including a legal 2 bedroom suite in the basement. Substantial renovations to the property include New windows, flooring throughout, new kitchen/bath on the main floor, and a renovated basement suite. Main and upper level are currently vacant but were bringing in $1700 per month in rent, and the basement is currently rented for $950 per month. Total income was $2,650 per month with tenants splitting the utilities. You could live upstairs with 4 bedrooms and 2 full baths and continue renting out the basement, or rent the whole thing out for a healthy cashflow of about $600 per month with 20% down and a 6% interest 25 year amortization mortgage. (Imagine what it would be once rates go down). The house could benefit from some fresh paint, new shingles and new high efficiency furnaces... but even as is offers excellent value for the dollar!",

Even with interest increase, this is still an affordable home in a great location close by many amenities and walking trails in a family friendly community. Better than renting because you are in charge of your expenses. The home would benefit from some TLC but that is where you can build some sweat equity in your home if you want it. Fancy a project, then the upstairs master bed closet is so large you may consider to turn it into an en-suite and really add value or if you rather, you could finish the basement if you feel that is an easier project to tackle. Main level features corner gas fireplace to add ambience when you want it. Kitchen has lots of cupboards and counter space so you have a lot of area when it comes to prep food. Sunny south facing deck and rear yard provides an ideal place if you like to grow things plus there is double detached garage with rear lane access.",
