      "description": "FANTASTIC 2-STOREY | DOUBLE ATTACHED GARAGE | UPGRADED HARDWOOD FLOORS | FULLY FENCED BACKYARD | FINISHED BASEMENT | FAMILY-FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD | EXCELLENT COMMUNITY  Definitely one of the nicest homes you are going to find. A very well-thought-out plan with a great layout. An open-concept kitchen with loads of cabinets and countertop space. Dining nook with patio doors that lead to the large beautiful backyard. An outdoor paradise is a place you can grow your own organic vegetables, a flower garden, or a place for the kids and dog to play. A bonus room could be an option, but this home prioritizes larger bedrooms with a massive master bedroom with 2nd and 3rd bedroom with a spacious living space in the finished basement. Located in a family-friendly community with tons of amenities with walking trails, a pond, a church, parks & playground, and grocery stores. Walking distance to the school with bus stops nearby. Easy access to the Anthony Henday Freeway and Edmonton International Airport. A true gem!",
