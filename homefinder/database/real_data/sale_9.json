Floorplan was the best floor plan of its day offering 3 bedrooms, den on main floor, open to below in the living room and an upstairs bonus room/loft. Original owner home selected every option available when originally built from the builder. Upgrades were done through out the home including kitchen cabinets, flooring, garage drain with water taps, 9 ft ceilings on the main and CENTRAL AIR. The home has great features that make it feel very grand and special compared to a lot of the competition on the market. Beautiful chandelier in the living room with 19' ceilings complimented by a stone faced fireplace with built in shelving. The master bedroom ensuite also features a soaker tub, glass shower, make up vanity and lots of storage. The home is located on the entrance of a small culdesac with a traditional lot (no zero) in the community of South Windermere.",
