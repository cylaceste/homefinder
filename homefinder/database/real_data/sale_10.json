Featuring 4 bedrooms, a massive living room, and a huge family room, you'll have plenty of space to enjoy life to the fullest in this home! The 2 bedrooms upstairs are currently connected, but could be easily made separated again. The ginormous yard is beautifully landscaped, featuring a pond, a large garden with raspberry bushes, flower beds, concrete patio, and fully grown mature trees. The oversized single car garage measures 13'3\\u0022 x 23', with plenty of space to fit a vehicle, tools, work bench, etc. Upgrades include: Furnace, HWT, Dryer, central vac, upstairs windows, and back patio.",
